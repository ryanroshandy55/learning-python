# Sorting Arrays
# Sorting means putting elements in an ordered sequence.
# Ordered sequence is any sequence that has an order corresponding to elements, like numeric or alphabetical, ascending or descending.
# The NumPy ndarray object has a function called sort(), that will sort a specified array.

# Example
# Sort the array:

import numpy as np

arr = np.array([3, 2, 0, 1])

print(np.sort(arr))
